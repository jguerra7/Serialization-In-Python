# JSON
The json module provides an interface similar to pickle for converting Python objects into
JavaScript Object Notation.
## Advantages:
> Suitable for use with other languages â€“ not Python-specific.
> Always text-based. No guessing.
> More readable than the pickle style.
> Not as dangerous as pickle.
> Faster than cpickle.
## Disadvantage:
> Not all Python types supported.
