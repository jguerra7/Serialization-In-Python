# JSON
The json module provides an interface similar to pickle for converting Python objects into
JavaScript Object Notation.
## Advantages:
1. Suitable for use with other languages â€“ not Python-specific.
2. Always text-based. No guessing.
3. More readable than the pickle style.
4. Not as dangerous as pickle.
5. Faster than cpickle.
## Disadvantage:
1. Not all Python types supported.
